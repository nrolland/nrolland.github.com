    <p><a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx">Convex optimization</a>

        This course really is foundational.
        You have probably are familiar with things like least square regression, and how it appears in many contexts.
        This is actually only a special case of convex optimisation which is used absolutely everywhere (most of the time unknowingly)
            (portfolio optimisation, factory production, kullback-leibler divergence, statistical mechanics, etc...)
        As such, convex optimisation is one of the big tool one should master, like geometry, or analysis.
