        This course really is foundational.
        You have probably are familiar with things like least square regression, and how it appears in many contexts.
        This is actually only a special case of convex optimisation which is used absolutely everywhere (most of the time unknowingly)
            (portfolio optimisation, factory production, kullback-leibler divergence, statistical mechanics, etc...)
        As such, convex optimisation is one of the big tool one should master, like geometry, or analysis.

    <p>I am NOT using Google Minus which is a hoose for horseshit, #LOLCAT, and even #LOLRAT </p>
    <p>I try to stay away of technology which will be obsolete by the time you know them</p>
